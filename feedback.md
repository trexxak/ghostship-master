# Project Health Report

## Overall Health
- **Health Score:** 72%
- **Summary:** Core simulations and services load without runtime errors, and the existing Django test suite is green when invoked directly. However, the default test command advertised in the repo executes zero tests, and several critical roadmap items remain outstanding, signalling moderate operational risk.

## Key Findings
- `python forum_simulator/manage.py test` completes successfully but discovers no tests, which can mask regressions unless contributors remember to target `forum.tests` explicitly.
- The targeted suite (`python forum_simulator/manage.py test forum.tests`) exercises 32 tests and currently passes, with OpenRouter gracefully failing over when the remote endpoint is unavailable.
- Static analysis via `python -m compileall forum_simulator/forum` succeeds, so there are no syntax errors in the shipped modules.
- The `todo.md` backlog highlights unfinished initiatives around automation, agent state modelling, and transparency tooling, indicating notable feature debt.

## Further Improvement Suggestions
### Immediate Wins
1. **Fix default test discovery** – adjust settings or add a custom test runner wrapper so `python forum_simulator/manage.py test` loads the `forum.tests` package by default, preventing silent CI gaps.
2. **Document OpenRouter offline behaviour** – clarify in developer docs what the fallback mode does during tests to reduce confusion when the warning appears.
3. **Add a quickstart smoke check** – provide a minimal management command or script for spinning up the simulation and confirming key routes render after setup.

### Big Win Potential
1. **Automate simulation scheduling** – implement the planned tick scheduler (e.g., Celery Beat) so operators no longer have to trigger ticks manually.
2. **Enhance agent state modelling** – tackle the backlog around needs drift, action scoring, and archetype templates to unlock richer simulation narratives.
3. **Invest in transparency tooling** – build the oracle canvas and replay scrubber described in `todo.md` to improve observability and debugging for complex runs.

## Next Roadmap Priorities
- **Simulation configuration surface** – expose cooldowns, needs drift, and oracle deck selection via TOML/JSON config so operators can tune runs without code edits.
- **Deterministic replay support** – persist tick seeds and expanded decision traces to enable reliable replay tooling.
